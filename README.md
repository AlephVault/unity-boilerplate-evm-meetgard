# A Meetgard boilerplate for Unity
This is a boilerplate project. It includes Meetgard and all the required dependencies, and will be tagged with local or specific versions of those dependency packages.

Unity version
-------------

The current status is meant to be used in Unity 2020.3 or better. The upper version is not yet determined, and lower versions are not supported (i.e. it may work, but with no responsibilities from the development side).

Dependencies versioning and status
----------------------------------

So far this project relies on a set of packages that I could consider, at best, in beta status. These packages are not officially released and they are called 0.0.1 or, at most, 0.0.2. A proper versioning has to be done. The referenced packages exist into this organization and must be cloned individually besides this boilerplate (i.e. as a sibling directory). They are:

 - com.alephvault.unity.binary: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-binary).
 - com.alephvault.unity.layout: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-layout).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard.auth: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard-auth).
 - com.alephvault.unity.meetgard.scopes: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-meetgard-scopes).
 - com.alephvault.unity.support: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-support).
 - com.alephvault.unity.support.generic: [Clone it](http://github.com/AlephVault/unity-support-generic).

TO-DO: Versions have to be properly linked even for this type of local downloads.
