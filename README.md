# A Meetgard and EVMGames boilerplate for Unity

This is a boilerplate project. It includes EVMGames/Meetgard and all the required dependencies, and will be tagged with local or specific versions of those dependency packages.

Unity version
-------------

The current status is meant to be used in Unity 2023.1 due to issues in previous versions.

Dependencies versioning and status
----------------------------------

So far this project relies on a set of packages that I could consider, at best, in beta status. These packages are not officially released and they are tagged 0.0.1. The referenced packages exist into this organization and must be cloned individually besides this boilerplate (i.e. as a sibling directory). They are:

You can run the attached scripts to clone the dependencies after cloning this project:

 - Windows: clone-all.bat
 - Unix-based (bash): clone-all.sh
 
If you have these repositories already cloned for another boilerplate and version, you can just go inside and checkout the proper (remote, typically) tags instead.
